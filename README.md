# CS-340-Client-Server-Development
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
For this course we worked on a full stack development using a CRUD module as the interface between our dashboard and database.
There were advantages to designing our program this way.  One of those being it made our create, read, update, and delete methods
portable to other projects as we could just import this module into any new project we developed in the future. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves breaking down complex problems into small pieces, each of which you can solve.
In this instance we first created a database that could hold our data.  We then added a layer of security by implementing authentication.
Next we developed our CRUD module to allow read and write access to our database.  And lastly we developed our GUI where a user could get
useful information and data from our program.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems.  In our project for this course it wasn't that the client had no way to do what we did manually.  The data
existed in several locations and they also knew what they were looking for.  What we as computer scientist were able to do was take all of this
data and quickly process it into a visual display so that the client could get the information they needed with minimal effort.  This allows them
to focus on their organizations objectives.  Not slogging through data to find the needle in the haystack.  We also made our application portable
and expandable so that our work can continue to deliver value to the customer and be implimented by other organizations as well.
